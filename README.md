# Sounds Aware 

Sounds Aware is a web application that uses machine learning to detect human-made sound (anthrophony) and masks it with ambient music as you walk around your environment.

To start using, just click the play button above. Sounds Aware will respond with pre-trained environmental sound tags. If the app senses less anthrophony and more biophony or geophony, then the music fades away, hopefully shifting your attention to all of the non human-made sounds around you.
  
If you find that the app is not accurately responding to the anthrophonic sounds, you can add your own tags in the 'Tag sounds' tab.
